# btc_parser
Here I wrote crypto price parser using asycnio and a model which can predict future movements

Project is not finished yet, there are ways how I will improve it:
1. Using time series I will predict crypto values
2. Predict using these values and previously built model value of DOT
3. Write website using FastAPI and Streamlit and deploy model
4. Run all using docker compose to update values of crypto and predict new values
